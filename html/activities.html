                    Lakshadweep has a largely uncharted surf-spot potential. It offers a
                    knowledgeable surf explorer quite a handful of interesting options. The prime
                    season for surfing in the Arabian Sea is between April and September as the
                    other months usually offer cleaner conditions, that is lesser wind. <br> Surfing in the
                    pristine blue-water barrels in this exotic location is a must have on your to do
                    list during your visit to these mesmerizing islands. The locals don’t surf in
                    Lakshadweep yet so you will have a curious audience watching from the pier.
                    As there are no surf shops in Lakshadweep, it is best to bring your surf
                    equipment with you. <br>Information on all the <em style="text-decoration: underline;"> necessary equipment needed to
                    surf</em> can be found <a style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.ripcurl.com/us/blog/surfing-for-beginners.html" onclick="return confirm('You are going to exit lakshadweep-tourism.herokuapp.com.\r\nClick OK to proceed or Cancel to continue.')"> here</a>. Lakshadweep is blessed with some of the world’s best reef breaks. Who
                    wouldn’t want to surf in these clear blue waters!

                    almost all dive sites. Minicoy has a 20 bedded resort for accommodating divers
                    and other tourists. <br> <br>

                      Agatti has one of the most beautiful lagoons in Lakshadweep and is considered
                      another Jewel from the group of islands.
                      Every corner of the island is rich with natural vegetation and beautiful
                      geographical formations.<br>
                      The island may be small compared to many other islands but it is nothing but a
                      sheer paradise for beach lovers and offbeat travellers.<br>
                      The locals mostly speak English and Malayalam, and Islam is the main religion
                      of the inhabitants. The primary occupation of the people is fishing.<br>

                      A 20-bed tourist complex with all modern amenities has been set up here.

                      Minicoy lies about 200 kms south of the northern group and has one of the largest lagoons with a small
                      uninhabited islet viringili on its southern side. <br>
                      Minicoy is distinct from the northern group of islands in terms of its cultures,
                      language, dressing style, etc. Traditionally, all powers to manage village affairs
                      are vested in an elected village elder called Bodukaka.<br>
                      This island is renowned for its tradition dance, the lava performed on festive
                      occasions & colourful race boats called “Jahadhoni” are a feast to the eyes.
                      Mahl is widely spoken here and the island is an important centre for
                      tuna fishing. <br>A majestic landmark here is the lighthouse built by the British.
                      The beaches have bathing huts with facilities for water
                      sports. 3 tourist cottages and one 20-bedded tourist home have
                      been constructed for staying tourists. Visit to Minicoy is part of Coral Reef and
                      Swaying Palm packages.

                      Kalpeni along with two small islets of Tilakkam and Pitti and the uninhabited
                      island of Cheriyam in the north form a single atoll.<br>
                      It is believed that a violent storm in the mid 1800s threw up huge coral
                      boulders along the shores resulting in the huge storm bank of coral debris
                      along its eastern and southeastern shorelines.<br>
                      It is a socially progressive island and it was here that girls first went to school
                      when women's education was considered taboo.<br>
                      One can swim, snorkel or reef-walk in the vast lagoon and indulge in water
                      sports on kayaks, sailboats and pedal boats.<br>
                      Two bathing huts with change rooms are available at Koomel Beach. Visit to
                      Kalpeni is part of Coral Reef package.

                      impart a bluish glow to the beach, which is totally enchanting.<br>

                      presence in the international tourist map.
